## Intro to HTML and CSS

Something new 
1. Learned about validators like this one https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
2. great resource on https://css-tricks.com




##html academy
A useful, but quite boring experience.

1. Didn't know about border-collapse for charts
cellpadding attribute
caption for tables
combibing different parts of the table
2. enjoyed part on selectors, had never had much experience with them
would definitely use pseudoclasses, I adore the idea of creating something interactive using the means of css
