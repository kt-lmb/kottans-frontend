I didn't like the course on Udacity much, but I enjoyed http://try.github.io/.
Guess, I'm more of a 'give me a cheat sheet and I'll figure it out' kind of person.
**name (at least) one thing that was new to you**: there's an actual way to remove everything and start over, which is great for a wreck like me
**name (at least) one thing that surprised you**: instead of manually reviewing two versions, you can use diff
**name (at least) one thing you intend to use in the future**: I definitely would use check status, cause I completely ignored it while reading about git before
