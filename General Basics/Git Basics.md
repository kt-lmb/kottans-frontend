I didn't like the course on Udacity much, but I enjoyed http://try.github.io/.
Guess, I'm more of a 'give me a cheat sheet and I'll figure it out' kind of person.

* something new: there's an actual way to remove everything and start over, which is great for a wreck like me
* something surprising: cherry-pick seems fun
* something of use: I definitely would use check status, cause I completely ignored it while reading about git before

### Outcomes 
*~/.gitconfig --global color.ui auto* for adding colors
*q* - leave from git log
